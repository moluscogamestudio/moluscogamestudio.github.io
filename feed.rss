<p>Welcome to Molusco Games. I've been trying to make games since 1992. Never succeeded, but I keep trying.
I have a few projects in development: a walking simulator, a medieval adventure, a turn based survival game, and so on. Everything is on very early stages of development so there's nothing to show yet.</p>

<p>Currently (August 2025) I'm undergoing a monthly challenge: every day I come up with a new videogame idea and write a few sentences about it. I'm on the 18th day, and when I reach the 31th idea, I'll pick <strong>one</strong> of those to fully develop as my first official game.</p>

<p>The idea is to pick something simple to test every aspect of game development, from the sketchboard to publishing.</p>
