The chosen one

Predictably, the one game I chose as a starter, was the unnamed **wizard** game.
I started prototyping the engine and writing some definitions, including a game design document. 

So far, it's nothing more than that: just a prototype using Kenney's 3D assets. The main goal is to test if the core game is fun or not: solve puzzles and don't get killed using magic in a dungeon.

Here's a quick demo:
