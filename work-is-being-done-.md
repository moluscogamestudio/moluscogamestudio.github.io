Work is being done 

I did some work. Mostly in the game design document, defining the mechanics and the spells. So far there are 50 spells and I don't know if I'll get to implement every one, but so far these three are implemented:

- Telekinesys: target an object and make it fly and move it to another place. Useful to move things around.
- Shrink: reduce yourself to one fifth of your regular size (and your speed). Use it to hide and to pass through small crevices.
- Swoosh: hurl yourself flying in a straight line at high speeds. Maybe useful to cross a chasm or to get away from danger.

Now the un-fun begins. The prototype seems to work and now I need to put some elbow grease on the programming. I need to write a few state machines to make things right. This will take some time. Some boring, boring time.
